#+TITLE: compose-language-server

Language Server for composing plain text. Supposed to bring smart compose like
feature while working with Emacs. Currently supports basic one word ahead
completion based on statistical language models.

The language server as of now consists of a KenLM binary =kenlm-completor= and a
node script =compose-ls=. Both of these can be built by running =make= (note that
you also need to build kenlm which is present in a git submodule). Run =make
install= to install =compose-ls=. You will also need to put =kenlm-completor= binary
in your =$PATH=.

#+begin_quote
kenlm-completor cli is going to be integrated as c++ node module in future
version.
#+end_quote

Once setup, the server can be started using something like the following:

#+begin_src shell
  # See kenlm's doc for building language models. Prefix size is the number of
  # tokens to be passed as context.
  compose-ls --stdio --kenlm-model-path /path/to/kenlm/language/model.arpa --kenlm-prefix-size 7
#+end_src

If you are using Emacs, there is a client connection setup for =mu4e-compose-mode=
(the place where I wanted to have completion) in =lsp-compose.el=.
